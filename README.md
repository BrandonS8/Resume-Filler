# Resume Filler

An open source chrome extension to copy and paste parts of your resume easier.

Made because online job applications never properly parse resumes and it can take 10+ mins to apply to a single job. Looking at you Workday.

### Future Goals / To Do

- More testing and error handling
- Auto fill
- JSON Import / Export (for additional backup option and useful for devs, even though it saves to google not locally)
- Cover letter with automatic variables (i.e. company name)
